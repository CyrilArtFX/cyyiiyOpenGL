# cyyiiy's personal OpenGL library

Currently in use for following the *learnopengl.com* tutorials for the project MinecraftOpenGL.

This repository act as a storage for all OpenGL related libraries and includes that I use in my OpenGL projects and will be updated when I need it.

There are a includes and a lib folder that are used for visual studio integration of those libraries for projects that need it.


### Use assimp

You need to put the assimp dll in your visual studio file where the .exe of the application is.
